The primary objective of my first task is to identify and recommend the elimination of underperforming campaigns using data visualization techniques.

By leveraging my skills in data analysis and visualization, I will analyze key performance metrics, such as the mean Cost per Result (CPR) and total impressions, to evaluate the effectiveness of each campaign. Through comprehensive data exploration and visualization, I will provide actionable insights to the finance team, helping them make informed decisions regarding campaign elimination.

Utilizing Python and popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I will transform raw campaign data into meaningful visual representations. This will enable the finance team to easily identify campaigns with suboptimal performance, prioritize resource allocation, and optimize the overall marketing strategy.

My approach involves grouping the data by campaign ID, calculating relevant metrics, and generating visualizations that highlight the performance of each campaign. By identifying the worst performing campaign based on mean CPR, I will provide a data-driven recommendation for its elimination.
